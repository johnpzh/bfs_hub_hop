• for both 3-hop and 4-hop:
• for each source node i:
	○ 1. Yi: when you meet any hub node, do not expand it and continue to traverse other non-hub nodes; Yi is the total number of nodes that you visit. 
	○ 2. Xi: the normal traversal. whenever you meet any hub or non-hub, visit them. Xi is the total number of nodes that you visit.
• plot: Yi/Xi for each source node i;
• calculate: the overall sum(Yi)/sum(Xi) for all 10K source nodes.
• This study will give us an upper-bound of our optimization benefits. Please stop by my office if there is any question.
